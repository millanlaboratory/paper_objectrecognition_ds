	abstract = {Objective. The ability of an automobile to infer the driver{\textquoteright}s upcoming actions directly from neural signals could enrich the interaction of the car with its driver. Intelligent vehicles fitted with an on-board brain{\textendash}computer interface able to decode the driver{\textquoteright}s intentions can use this information to improve the driving experience. In this study we investigate the neural signatures of anticipation of specific actions, namely braking and accelerating. Approach. We investigated anticipatory slow cortical potentials in electroencephalogram recorded from 18 healthy participants in a driving simulator using a variant of the contingent negative variation (CNV) paradigm with Go and No-go conditions: count-down numbers followed by {\textquoteleft}Start{\textquoteright}/{\textquoteleft}Stop{\textquoteright} cue. We report decoding performance before the action onset using a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier based on temporal features. Main results. (i) Despite the visual and driving related cognitive distractions, we show the presence of anticipatory event related potentials locked to the stimuli onset similar to the widely reported CNV signal (with an average peak value of -8 $\mu$ V at electrode Cz). (ii) We demonstrate the discrimination between cases requiring to perform an action upon imperative subsequent stimulus ( Go condition, e.g. a {\textquoteleft}Red{\textquoteright} traffic light) versus events that do not require such action ( No-go condition; e.g. a {\textquoteleft}Yellow{\textquoteright} light); with an average single trial classification performance of 0.83 {\textpm} 0.13 for braking and 0.79 {\textpm} 0.12 for accelerating (area under the curve). (iii) We show that the centro-medial anticipatory potentials are observed as early as 320 {\textpm} 200 ms before the action with a detection rate of 0.77 {\textpm} 0.12 in offline analysis. Significance. We show for the first time the feasibility of predicting the driver{\textquoteright}s intention through decoding anticipatory related potentials during simulated car driving with high recognition rates.},

	abstract = {Objective . State-of-the-art experiments for studying neural processes underlying visual cognition often constrain sensory inputs (e.g., static images) and our behavior (e.g., fixed eye-gaze, long eye fixations), isolating or simplifying the interaction of neural processes. Motivated by the non-stationarity of our natural visual environment, we investigated the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of visual recognition while participants overtly performed visual search in non-stationary scenes. We hypothesized that visual effects (such as those typically used in human{\textendash}computer interfaces) may increase temporal uncertainty (with reference to fixation onset) of cognition-related EEG activity in an active search task and therefore require novel techniques for single-trial detection. Approach. We addressed fixation-related EEG activity in an active search task with respect to stimulus-appearance styles and dynamics. Alongside popping-up stimuli, our experimental study embraces two composite appearance styles based on fading-in, enlarging , and motion effects. Additionally, we explored whether the knowledge obtained in the pop-up experimental setting can be exploited to boost the EEG-based intention-decoding performance when facing transitional changes of visual content. Main results. The results confirmed our initial hypothesis that the dynamic of visual content can increase temporal uncertainty of the cognition-related EEG activity in active search with respect to fixation onset. This temporal uncertainty challenges the pivotal aim to keep the decoding performance constant irrespective of visual effects. Importantly, the proposed approach for EEG decoding based on knowledge transfer between the different experimental settings gave a promising performance. Significance. Our study demonstrates that the non-stationarity of visual scenes is an important factor in the evolution of cognitive processes, as well as in the dynamic of ocular behavior (i.e., dwell time and fixation duration) in an active search task. In addition, our method to improve single-trial detection performance in this adverse scenario is an important step in making brain{\textendash}computer interfacing technology available for human{\textendash}computer interaction applications.},

Signals bearing these very properties have been characterized in single neurons in monkeys, but have yet to be directly identified in humans. Using a gradual target detection task, we isolated a freely evolving decision variable signal in human subjects that exhibited every aspect of the dynamics observed in its single-neuron counterparts. This signal could be continuously tracked in parallel with fully dissociable sensory encoding and motor preparation signals, and could be systematically perturbed mid-flight during decision formation. Furthermore, we found that the signal was completely domain general: it exhibited the same decision-predictive dynamics regardless of sensory modality and stimulus features and tracked cumulative evidence even in the absence of overt action. These findings provide a uniquely clear view on the neural determinants of simple perceptual decisions in humans.},

Some are acted upon immediately, but many more become mental notes or fleeting impressions{\textemdash}our implicit {\textquoteleft}labeling{\textquoteright} of the world. In this paper, we use physiological correlates of this labeling to construct a hybrid brain{\textendash}computer interface (hBCI) system for efficient navigation of a 3D environment. Approach. First, we record electroencephalographic (EEG), saccadic and pupillary data from subjects as they move through a small part of a 3D virtual city under free-viewing conditions. Using machine learning, we integrate the neural and ocular signals evoked by the objects they encounter to infer which ones are of subjective interest to them. These inferred labels are propagated through a large computer vision graph of objects in the city, using semi-supervised learning to identify other, unseen objects that are visually similar to the labeled ones. Finally, the system plots an efficient route to help the subjects visit the {\textquoteleft}similar{\textquoteright} objects it identifies. Main results. We show that by exploiting the subjects{\textquoteright} implicit labeling to find objects of interest instead of exploring naively, the median search precision is increased from 25\% to 97\%, and the median subject need only travel 40\% of the distance to see 84\% of the objects of interest. We also find that the neural and ocular signals contribute in a complementary fashion to the classifiers{\textquoteright} inference of subjects{\textquoteright} implicit labeling. Significance. In summary, we show that neural and ocular signals reflecting subjective assessment of objects in a 3D environment can be used to inform a graph-based learning model of that environment, resulting in an hBCI system that improves navigation and information delivery specific to the user{\textquoteright}s interests.},

	abstract = {Important requirements for the analysis of multichannel EEG data are efficient techniques for signal enhancement, signal decomposition, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction. We propose a new approach for spatial harmonic analysis (SPHARA) that extends the classical spatial Fourier analysis to EEG sensors positioned non-uniformly on the surface of the head. The proposed method is based on the eigenanalysis of the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator defined on a triangular mesh. We present several ways to discretize the continuous Laplace-Beltrami operator and compare the properties of the resulting basis functions computed using these discretization methods. We apply SPHARA to somatosensory evoked potential data from eleven volunteers and demonstrate the ability of the method for spatial data decomposition, dimensionality reduction and noise suppression. When employing SPHARA for dimensionality reduction, a significantly more compact representation can be achieved using the FEM approach, compared to the other discretization methods. Using FEM, to recover 95\% and 99\% of the total energy of the EEG data, on average only 35\% and 58\% of the coefficients are necessary. The capability of SPHARA for noise suppression is shown using artificial data. We conclude that SPHARA can be used for spatial harmonic analysis of multi-sensor data at arbitrary positions and can be utilized in a variety of other applications.},

	abstract = {Co-registration of EEG and eye movement has promise for investigating perceptual processes in free viewing conditions, provided certain methodological challenges can be addressed. Most of these arise from the self-paced character of eye movements in free viewing conditions. Successive eye movements occur within short time intervals. Their evoked activity is likely to distort the EEG signal during fixation. Due to the non-uniform distribution of fixation durations, these distortions are systematic, survive across-trials averaging, and can become a source of confounding. We illustrate this problem with effects of sequential eye movements on the evoked potentials and time-frequency components of EEG and propose a solution based on matching of eye movement characteristics between experimental conditions. The proposal leads to a discussion of which eye movement characteristics are to be matched, depending on the EEG activity of interest. We also compare segmentation of EEG into saccade-related epochs relative to saccade and fixation onsets and discuss the problem of baseline selection and its solution. Further recommendations are given for implementing EEG-eye movement co-registration in free viewing conditions. By resolving some of the methodological problems involved, we aim to facilitate the transition from the traditional stimulus-response paradigm to the study of visual perception in more naturalistic conditions.},

The neural loci of P3a and P3b generation are outlined, and a cognitive model is proffered: P3a originates from stimulus-driven frontal attention mechanisms during task processing, whereas P3b originates from temporal-parietal activity associated with attention and appears related to subsequent memory processing. Neurotransmitter actions associating P3a to frontal/dopaminergic and P3b to parietal/norepinephrine pathways are highlighted.

	abstract = {Objectives. Recent studies have started to explore the implementation of brain{\textendash}computer interfaces (BCI) as part of driving assistant systems. The current study presents an EEG-based BCI that decodes error-related brain activity. Such information can be used, e.g., to predict driver{\textquoteright}s intended turning direction before reaching road intersections. Approach. We executed experiments in a car simulator ( N = 22) and a real car ( N = 8). While subject was driving, a directional cue was shown before reaching an intersection, and we classified the presence or not of an error-related potentials from EEG to infer whether the cued direction coincided with the subject{\textquoteright}s intention. In this protocol, the directional cue can correspond to an estimation of the driving direction provided by a driving assistance system. We analyzed ERPs elicited during normal driving and evaluated the classification performance in both offline and online tests. Results. An average classification accuracy of 0.698 {\textpm} 0.065 was obtained in offline experiments in the car simulator, while tests in the real car yielded a performance of 0.682 {\textpm} 0.059. The results were significantly higher than chance level for all cases. Online experiments led to equivalent performances in both simulated and real car driving experiments. These results support the feasibility of decoding these signals to help estimating whether the driver{\textquoteright}s intention coincides with the advice provided by the driving assistant in a real car. Significance. The study demonstrates a BCI system in real-world driving, extending the work from previous simulated studies. As far as we know, this is the first online study in real car decoding driver{\textquoteright}s error-related brain activity. Given the encouraging results, the paradigm could be further improved by using more sophisticated machine learning approaches and possibly be combined with applications in intelligent vehicles.},

A target image in a sequence of nontarget distractor images elicits in the EEG a stereotypical spatiotemporal response, which can be detected. A pattern classifier uses this response to reprioritize the image sequence, placing detected targets in the front of an image stack. We use single-trial analysis based on linear discrimination to recover spatial components that reflect differences in EEG activity evoked by target versus nontarget images. We find an optimal set of spatial weights for 59 EEG sensors within a sliding 50-ms time window. Using this simple classifier allows us to process EEG in real time. The detection accuracy across five subjects is on average 92\%, i.e., in a sequence of 2500 images, resorting images based on detector output results in 92\% of target images being moved from a random position in the sequence to one of the first 250 images (first 10\% of the sequence). The approach leverages the highly robust and invariant object recognition capabilities of the human visual system, using single-trial EEG analysis to efficiently detect neural signatures correlated with the recognition event.},

The fact that all human action is preceded by brain processes partially observable through neuroimaging devices such as electroencephalography (EEG) is currently being explored in a number of applications. A recent study by Haufe et al (2011 J. Neural Eng. 8 056001) demonstrates the possibility of performing fast detection of forced emergency brakings during driving based on EEG and electromyography, and discusses the use of such neurotechnology for braking assistance systems. Since the study was conducted in a driving simulator, its significance regarding real-world applicability needs to be assessed. Approach. Here, we replicate that experimental paradigm in a real car on a non-public test track. Main results. Our results resemble those of the simulator study, both qualitatively (in terms of the neurophysiological phenomena observed and utilized) and quantitatively (in terms of the predictive improvement achievable using electrophysiology in addition to behavioral measures). Moreover, our findings are robust with respect to a temporary secondary auditory task mimicking verbal input from a fellow passenger. Significance. Our study serves as a real-world verification of the feasibility of electrophysiology-based detection of emergency braking intention as proposed in Haufe et al (2011 J. Neural Eng. 8 056001).},

Although eye-tracking research in these participant groups has become easier with the advance of the remote eye-tracker, this often comes at the cost of poorer data quality than in research with well-trained adults (Hessels, Andersson, Hooge, Nystr{\"o}m, \& Kemner Infancy, 20, 601{\textendash}633, ; Wass, Forssman, \& Lepp{\"a}nen Infancy, 19, 427{\textendash}460, ). Current fixation detection algorithms are not built for data from infants and young children. As a result, some researchers have even turned to hand correction of fixation detections (Saez de Urabain, Johnson, \& Smith Behavior Research Methods, 47, 53{\textendash}72, ). Here we introduce a fixation detection algorithm{\textemdash}identification by two-means clustering (I2MC){\textemdash}built specifically for data across a wide range of noise levels and when periods of data loss may occur. We evaluated the I2MC algorithm against seven state-of-the-art event detection algorithms, and report that the I2MC algorithm{\textquoteright}s output is the most robust to high noise and data loss levels. The algorithm is automatic, works offline, and is suitable for eye-tracking data recorded with remote or tower-mounted eye-trackers using static stimuli. In addition to application of the I2MC algorithm in eye-tracking research with infants, school children, and certain patient groups, the I2MC algorithm also may be useful when the noise and data loss levels are markedly different between trials, participants, or time points (e.g., longitudinal research).},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new classification framework for brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery. This framework involves the concept of Riemannian geometry in the manifold of covariance matrices. The main idea is to use spatial covariance matrices as EEG signal descriptors and to rely on Riemannian geometry to directly classify these matrices using the topology of the manifold of symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrices. This framework allows to extract the spatial information contained in EEG signals without using spatial filtering. Two methods are proposed and compared with a reference method [multiclass Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)] on the multiclass dataset IIa from the BCI Competition IV. The first method, named minimum distance to Riemannian mean (MDRM), is an implementation of the minimum distance to mean (MDM) classification algorithm using Riemannian distance and Riemannian mean. This simple method shows comparable results with the reference method. The second method, named tangent space LDA (TSLDA), maps the covariance matrices onto the Riemannian tangent space where matrices can be vectorized and treated as Euclidean objects. Then, a variable selection procedure is applied in order to decrease dimensionality and a classification by LDA is performed. This latter method outperforms the reference method increasing the mean classification accuracy from 65.1\% to 70.2\%.},

Experiments with 7 healthy human subjects yield an average classification 0.69{\textpm}0.16, which confirms the feasibility of decoding these signals to help estimating driver's turning direction.

Although many BCI-spellers have been developed during the last few decades, to our knowledge, no reviews have described the different spellers proposed and studied in this vital field. The presented speller systems are categorized according to major BCI paradigms: P300, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), and motor imagery (MI). Different BCI paradigms require specific electroencephalogram (EEG) signal features and lead to the development of appropriate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). The purpose of this review is to consolidate the most successful BCI-spellers published since 2010, while mentioning some other older systems which were built explicitly for spelling purposes. We aim to assist researchers and concerned individuals in the field by illustrating the highlights of different spellers and presenting them in one review. It is almost impossible to carry out an objective comparison between different spellers, as each has its variables, parameters, and conditions. However, the gathered information and the provided taxonomy about different BCI-spellers can be helpful, as it could identify suitable systems for first-hand users, as well as opportunities of development and learning from previous studies for BCI researchers.},

After calibration, the system allowed the user to communicate via EEG. Re-calibration was performed remotely (via the internet), and BCI accuracy assessed in periodic tests. Reports of BCI usefulness by the user and the family were also recorded. Results showed that BCI accuracy remained at 83\% (r = -.07, n.s.) for over 2.5 years (1.4\% expected by chance). The BCI user and his family state that the BCI had restored his independence in social interactions and at work. He uses the BCI to run his NIH-funded research laboratory and to communicate via e-mail with family, friends, and colleagues. In addition to this first user, several other similarly disabled people are now using the BCI in their daily lives.

	abstract = {Objective
Despite intense brain-computer interface (BCI) research for {\textgreater}2 decades, BCIs have hardly been established at patients' homes. The current study aimed at demonstrating expert independent BCI home use by a patient in the locked-in state and the effect it has on quality of life.
Design
In this case study, the P300 BCI-controlled application Brain Painting was facilitated and installed at the patient's home. Family and caregivers were trained in setting up the BCI system. After every BCI session, the end user indicated subjective level of control, loss of control, level of exhaustion, satisfaction, frustration, and enjoyment. To monitor BCI home use, evaluation data of every session were automatically sent and stored on a remote server. Satisfaction with the BCI as an assistive device and subjective workload was indicated by the patient. In accordance with the user-centered design, usability of the BCI was evaluated in terms of its effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The influence of the BCI on quality of life of the end user was assessed.
Setting
At the patient's home.
Participant
A 73-year-old patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the locked-in state.
Interventions
Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measure
The BCI has been used by the patient independent of experts for {\textgreater}14 months. The patient painted in about 200 BCI sessions (1{\textendash}3 times per week) with a mean painting duration of 81.86 minutes (SD=52.15, maximum: 230.41). BCI improved quality of life of the patient.
Results
In most of the BCI sessions the end user's satisfaction was high (mean=7.4, SD=3.24; range, 0{\textendash}10). Dissatisfaction occurred mostly because of technical problems at the beginning of the study or varying BCI control. The subjective workload was moderate (mean=40.61; range, 0{\textendash}100). The end user was highy satisfied with all components of the BCI (mean 4.42{\textendash}5.0; range, 1{\textendash}5). A perfect match between the user and the BCI technology was achieved (mean: 4.8; range, 1{\textendash}5). Brain Painting had a positive impact on the patient's life on all three dimensions: competence (1.5), adaptability (2.17) and self-esteem (1.5); (range: {\textendash}3 = maximum negative impact; 3 maximum positive impact). The patient had her first public art exhibition in July 2013; future exhibitions are in preparation.
Conclusions
Independent BCI home use is possible with high satisfaction for the end user. The BCI indeed positively influenced quality of life of the patient and supports social inclusion. Results demonstrate that visual P300 BCIs can be valuable for patients in the locked-in state even if other means of communication are still available (eye tracker).},

In this context, the visual P300 potential appears suited to control smart homes through BCI spellers. The aim of this work is to evaluate whether the widely used character-speller is more sustainable than an icon-based one, designed to operate smart home environment or to communicate moods and needs. Nine subjects with neurodegenerative diseases and no BCI experience used both speller types in a real smart home environment. User experience during BCI tasks was evaluated recording concurrent physiological signals. Usability was assessed for each speller type immediately after use. Classification accuracy was lower for the icon-speller, which was also more attention demanding. However, in subjective evaluations, the effect of a real feedback partially counterbalanced the difficulty in BCI use. Practitioner Summary: Since inclusive BCIs require to consider interface sustainability, we evaluated different ergonomic aspects of the interaction of disabled users with a character-speller (goal: word spelling) and an icon-speller (goal: operating a real smart home). We found the first one as more sustainable in terms of accuracy and cognitive effort.},

	abstract = {In contrast to static imagery, detection of events of interest in video involves evidence accumulation across space and time; the observer is required to integrate features from both motion and form to decide whether a behavior constituents a target event. Do such events that extend in time elicit evoked responses of similar strength as evoked responses associated with instantaneous events such as the presentation of a static target image? Using a set of simulated scenarios, with avatars/actors having different behaviors, we identified evoked neural activity discriminative of target vs. distractor events (behaviors) at discrimination levels that are comparable to static imagery. EEG discriminative activity was largely in the time-locked evoked response and not in oscillatory activity, with the exception of very low EEG frequency bands such as delta and theta, which simply represent bands dominating the event related potential (ERP). The discriminative evoked response activity we see is observed in all target/distractor conditions and is robust across different recordings from the same subjects. The results suggest that we have identified a robust neural correlate of target detection in video, at least in terms of the stimulus set we used{\textemdash}i.e., dynamic behavior of an individual in a low clutter environment. Additional work is needed to test a larger variety of behaviors and more diverse environments.},

	abstract = {Objective
A fully automated method for reducing EOG artifacts is presented and validated. Methods
The correction method is based on regression analysis and was applied to 18 recordings with 22 channels and approx. 6min each. Two independent experts scored the original and corrected EEG in a blinded evaluation.
Results
The expert scorers identified in 5.9\% of the raw data some EOG artifacts; 4.7\% were corrected. After applying the EOG correction, the expert scorers identified in another 1.9\% of the data some EOG artifacts, which were not recognized in the uncorrected data.
Conclusions
The advantage of a fully automated reduction of EOG artifacts justifies the small additional effort of the proposed method and is a viable option for reducing EOG artifacts. The method has been implemented for offline and online analysis and is available through BioSig, an open source software library for biomedical signal processing.
Significance
Visual identification and rejection of EOG-contaminated EEG segments can miss many EOG artifacts, and is therefore not sufficient for removing EOG artifacts. The proposed method was able to reduce EOG artifacts by 80\%.},

One aim of the present study was to extend past work by obtaining a response-independent index of attention allocation sensitive to changes in discrete stages of information processing. An additional goal was to explore the potential time course of differential sensitivity to self-relevant cues. We assessed the P300, an ERP component that provides an index of attentional resources, evoked by autobiographical self-relevant stimuli (e.g., one{\textquoteright}s own name). As expected, P300 was augmented for self-relevant stimuli relative to control stimuli. In addition, analyses of P300 latency indicate that the effects of self-relevance are present during higher-order stages of cognitive processing related to selective attention. These results complement and extend previous work on the role of self-relevance in the selection of material for further processing.},

In movement time, precision, and accuracy, the results are comparable to those with invasive BCIs.

	abstract = {Objective
Connect-Four, a new sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) based brain{\textendash}computer interface (BCI) gaming application, was evaluated by four severely motor restricted end-users; two were in the locked-in state and had unreliable eye-movement.
Methods
Following the user-centred approach, usability of the BCI prototype was evaluated in terms of effectiveness (accuracy), efficiency (information transfer rate (ITR) and subjective workload) and users{\textquoteright} satisfaction.
Results
Online performance varied strongly across users and sessions (median accuracy (\%) of end-users: A=.65; B=.60; C=.47; D=.77). Our results thus yielded low to medium effectiveness in three end-users and high effectiveness in one end-user. Consequently, ITR was low (0.05{\textendash}1.44bits/min). Only two end-users were able to play the game in free-mode. Total workload was moderate but varied strongly across sessions. Main sources of workload were mental and temporal demand. Furthermore, frustration contributed to the subjective workload of two end-users. Nevertheless, most end-users accepted the BCI application well and rated satisfaction medium to high. Sources for dissatisfaction were (1) electrode gel and cap, (2) low effectiveness, (3) time-consuming adjustment and (4) not easy-to-use BCI equipment. All four end-users indicated ease of use as being one of the most important aspect of BCI.
Conclusion
Effectiveness and efficiency are lower as compared to applications using the event-related potential as input channel. Nevertheless, the SMR-BCI application was satisfactorily accepted by the end-users and two of four could imagine using the BCI application in their daily life. Thus, despite moderate effectiveness and efficiency BCIs might be an option when controlling an application for entertainment.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Brain{\textendash}computer interfaces (BCIs) are no longer only used by healthy participants under controlled conditions in laboratory environments, but also by patients and end-users, controlling applications in their homes or clinics, without the BCI experts around. But are the technology and the field mature enough for this? Especially the successful operation of applications {\textendash} like text entry systems or assistive mobility devices such as tele-presence robots {\textendash} requires a good level of BCI control. How much training is needed to achieve such a level? Is it possible to train na{\"i}ve end-users in 10 days to successfully control such applications?
Materials and methods
In this work, we report our experiences of training 24 motor-disabled participants at rehabilitation clinics or at the end-users{\textquoteright} homes, without BCI experts present. We also share the lessons that we have learned through transferring BCI technologies from the lab to the user's home or clinics.
Results
The most important outcome is that 50\% of the participants achieved good BCI performance and could successfully control the applications (tele-presence robot and text-entry system). In the case of the tele-presence robot the participants achieved an average performance ratio of 0.87 (max. 0.97) and for the text entry application a mean of 0.93 (max. 1.0). The lessons learned and the gathered user feedback range from pure BCI problems (technical and handling), to common communication issues among the different people involved, and issues encountered while controlling the applications.
Conclusion
The points raised in this paper are very widely applicable and we anticipate that they might be faced similarly by other groups, if they move on to bringing the BCI technology to the end-user, to home environments and towards application prototype control.},

	abstract = {Objective. While brain{\textendash}computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication have reached considerable technical maturity, there is still a great need for state-of-the-art evaluation by the end-users outside laboratory environments. To achieve this primary objective, it is necessary to augment a BCI with a series of components that allow end-users to type text effectively. Approach. This work presents the clinical evaluation of a motor imagery (MI) BCI text-speller, called BrainTree, by six severely disabled end-users and ten able-bodied users. Additionally, we define a generic model of code-based BCI applications, which serves as an analytical tool for evaluation and design. Main results. We show that all users achieved remarkable usability and efficiency outcomes in spelling. Furthermore, our model-based analysis highlights the added value of human{\textendash}computer interaction techniques and hybrid BCI error-handling mechanisms, and reveals the effects of BCI performances on usability and efficiency in code-based applications. Significance. This study demonstrates the usability potential of code-based MI spellers, with BrainTree being the first to be evaluated by a substantial number of end-users, establishing them as a viable, competitive alternative to other popular BCI spellers. Another major outcome of our model-based analysis is the derivation of a 80\% minimum command accuracy requirement for successful code-based application control, revising upwards previous estimates attempted in the literature.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate how the concept of shared control-which interprets the user's commands in context-empowers users to perform rather complex tasks without a high workload. We present the results of nine end-users with motor disabilities who were able to complete navigation tasks with a telepresence robot successfully in a remote environment (in some cases in a different country) that they had never previously visited.

	abstract = {Performance variation is one of the main challenges that BCIs are confronted with, when being used over extended periods of time. Shared control techniques could partially cope with such a problem. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of shared control approaches used for BCIs and we review some of the recent studies at the light of these approaches. We posit that the level of assistance provided to the BCI user should be adjusted in real time in order to enhance BCI reliability over time. This approach has not been extensively studied in the recent literature on BCIs. In addition, we investigate the effectiveness of providing online adaptive assistance in a motor-imagery BCI for a tetraplegic end-user with an incomplete locked-in syndrome in a longitudinal study lasting 11 months. First, we report a reliable estimation of the BCI performance (in terms of command delivery time) using only a window of 1 s in the beginning of trials (AUC ? 0.8). Second, we demonstrate how adaptive shared control can exploit the output of the performance estimator to adjust online the level of assistance in a BCI game by regulating its speed. In particular, online adaptive assistance was superior to a fixed condition in terms of success rate (p {\textless}; 0.01). Remarkably, the results exhibited a stable performance over several months without recalibration of the BCI classifier or the performance estimator.},

	abstract = {Objective
To assess the reliability and usefulness of an EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) for patients with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who used it independently at home for up to 18 months.

Methods
Of 42 patients consented, 39 (93\%) met the study criteria, and 37 (88\%) were assessed for use of the Wadsworth BCI. Nine (21\%) could not use the BCI. Of the other 28, 27 (men, age 28{\textendash}79 years) (64\%) had the BCI placed in their homes, and they and their caregivers were trained to use it. Use data were collected by Internet. Periodic visits evaluated BCI benefit and burden and quality of life.

Results
Over subsequent months, 12 (29\% of the original 42) left the study because of death or rapid disease progression and 6 (14\%) left because of decreased interest. Fourteen (33\%) completed training and used the BCI independently, mainly for communication. Technical problems were rare. Patient and caregiver ratings indicated that BCI benefit exceeded burden. Quality of life remained stable. Of those not lost to the disease, half completed the study; all but 1 patient kept the BCI for further use.

Conclusion
The Wadsworth BCI home system can function reliably and usefully when operated by patients in their homes. BCIs that support communication are at present most suitable for people who are severely disabled but are otherwise in stable health. Improvements in BCI convenience and performance, including some now underway, should increase the number of people who find them useful and the extent to which they are used.},

Chronic stroke patients with severe hand weakness, respond poorly to rehabilitation efforts. Here, we evaluated efficacy of daily brain-machine-interface training to increase the hypothesized beneficial effects of physiotherapy alone in patients with severe paresis in a double blind sham-controlled design proof of concept study.

Methods
32 chronic stroke patients with severe hand weakness, were randomly assigned to two matched groups and participated in 17.8 {\textpm} 1.4 days of training rewarding desynchronization of ipsilesional oscillatory sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) with contingent online movements of hand and arm orthoses (experimental group , n=16). In the control group (sham group, n=16) movements of the orthoses occurred randomly. Both groups received identical behavioral physiotherapy immediately following BMI training or the control intervention. Upper limb motor function scores, electromyography from arm and hand muscles, placebo-expectancy effects and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) blood oxygenation level dependent activity were assessed before and after intervention.

Results
A significant group {\texttimes} time interaction in upper limb Fugl-Meyer motor (cFMA) scores was found. cFMA scores improved more in the experimental than in the control group, presenting a significant improvement of cFMA scores (3.41{\textpm}0.563 points difference, p=0.018) reflecting a clinically meaningful change from no activity to some in paretic muscles. cFMA improvements in the experimental group correlated with changes in functional MRI laterality index and with paretic hand electromyography activity. Placebo-expectancy scores were comparable for both groups.

Interpretation
The addition of BMI training to behaviorally oriented physiotherapy can be used to induce functional improvements in motor function in chronic stroke patients without residual finger movements and may open a new door in stroke neurorehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Objective Motor imagery (MI) is assumed to enhance poststroke motor recovery, yet its benefits are debatable. Brain{\textendash}computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide instantaneous and quantitative measure of cerebral functions modulated by MI. The efficacy of BCI-monitored MI practice as add-on intervention to usual rehabilitation care was evaluated in a randomized controlled pilot study in subacute stroke patients. Methods Twenty-eight hospitalized subacute stroke patients with severe motor deficits were randomized into 2 intervention groups: 1-month BCI-supported MI training (BCI group, n = 14) and 1-month MI training without BCI support (control group; n = 14). Functional and neurophysiological assessments were performed before and after the interventions, including evaluation of the upper limbs by Fugl{\textendash}Meyer Assessment (FMA; primary outcome measure) and analysis of oscillatory activity and connectivity at rest, based on high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Results Better functional outcome was observed in the BCI group, including a significantly higher probability of achieving a clinically relevant increase in the FMA score (p {\textless} 0.03). Post-BCI training changes in EEG sensorimotor power spectra (ie, stronger desynchronization in the alpha and beta bands) occurred with greater involvement of the ipsilesional hemisphere in response to MI of the paralyzed trained hand. Also, FMA improvements (effectiveness of FMA) correlated with the changes (ie, post-training increase) at rest in ipsilesional intrahemispheric connectivity in the same bands (p {\textless} 0.05). Interpretation The introduction of BCI technology in assisting MI practice demonstrates the rehabilitative potential of MI, contributing to significantly better motor functional outcomes in subacute stroke patients with severe motor impairments.

	abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide sensory feedback of ongoing brain oscillations, enabling stroke survivors to modulate their sensorimotor rhythms purposefully. A number of recent clinical studies indicate that repeated use of such BCIs might trigger neurological recovery and hence improvement in motor function. Here, we provide a first meta-analysis evaluating the clinical effectiveness of BCI-based post-stroke motor rehabilitation. Trials were identified using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, PEDro and by inspection of references in several review articles. We selected randomized controlled trials that used BCIs for post-stroke motor rehabilitation and provided motor impairment scores before and after the intervention. A random-effects inverse variance method was used to calculate the summary effect size. We initially identified 524 articles and, after removing duplicates, we screened titles and abstracts of 473 articles. We found 26 articles corresponding to BCI clinical trials, of these, there were nine studies that involved a total of 235 post-stroke survivors that fulfilled the inclusion criterion (randomized controlled trials that examined motor performance as an outcome measure) for the meta-analysis. Motor improvements, mostly quantified by the upper limb Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA-UE), exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID=5.25) in six BCI studies, while such improvement was reached only in three control groups. Overall, the BCI training was associated with a standardized mean difference of 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.37 to 1.20) in FMA-UE compared to control conditions, which is in the range of medium to large summary effect size. In addition, several studies indicated BCI-induced functional and structural neuroplasticity at a subclinical level. This suggests that BCI technology could be an effective intervention for post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation. However, more studies with larger sample size are required to increase the reliability of these results.},

In this study we investigate the neural signatures of anticipation of specific actions, namely braking and accelerating. Approach. We investigated anticipatory slow cortical potentials in electroencephalogram recorded from 18 healthy participants in a driving simulator using a variant of the contingent negative variation (CNV) paradigm with Go and No-go conditions: count-down numbers followed by {\textquoteleft}Start{\textquoteright}/{\textquoteleft}Stop{\textquoteright} cue. We report decoding performance before the action onset using a quadratic discriminant analysis classifier based on temporal features. Main results. (i) Despite the visual and driving related cognitive distractions, we show the presence of anticipatory event related potentials locked to the stimuli onset similar to the widely reported CNV signal (with an average peak value of -8 $\mu$V at electrode Cz). (ii) We demonstrate the discrimination between cases requiring to perform an action upon imperative subsequent stimulus (Go condition, e.g. a {\textquoteleft}Red{\textquoteright} traffic light) versus events that do not require such action (No-go condition; e.g. a {\textquoteleft}Yellow{\textquoteright} light); with an average single trial classification performance of 0.83 {\textpm} 0.13 for braking and 0.79 {\textpm} 0.12 for accelerating (area under the curve). (iii) We show that the centro-medial anticipatory potentials are observed as early as 320 {\textpm} 200 ms before the action with a detection rate of 0.77 {\textpm} 0.12 in offline analysis.

	abstract = {Modern cars can support their drivers by assessing and autonomously performing different driving maneuvers based on information gathered by in-car sensors. We propose that brain- machine interfaces (BMIs) can provide complementary information that can ease the interaction with intelligent cars in order to enhance the driving experience. In our approach, the human remains in control, while a BMI is used to monitor the driver's cognitive state and use that information to modulate the assistance provided by the intelligent car. In this paper, we gather our proof-of-concept studies demonstrating the feasibility of decoding electroencephalography correlates of upcoming actions and those reflecting whether the decisions of driving assistant systems are in-line with the drivers' intentions. Experimental results while driving both simulated and real cars consistently showed neural signatures of anticipation, movement preparation, and error processing. Remarkably, despite the increased noise inherent to real scenarios, these signals can be decoded on a single-trial basis, reflecting some of the cognitive processes that take place while driving. However, moderate decoding performance compared to the controlled experimental BMI paradigms indicate there exists room for improvement of the machine learning methods typically used in the state-of-the-art BMIs. We foresee that neural fusion correlates with information extracted from other physiological measures, e.g., eye movements or electromyography as well as contextual information gathered by in-car sensors will allow intelligent cars to provide timely and tailored assistance only if it is required; thus, keeping the user in the loop and allowing him to fully enjoy the driving experience.},

	abstract = {We revisit the framework for brain-coupled image search, where the Electroencephalography (EEG) channel under rapid serial visual presentation protocol is used to detect user preferences. Extending previous works on the synergy between content-based image labeling and EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI), we propose a different perspective on iterative coupling. Previously, the iterations were used to improve the set of EEG-based image labels before propagating them to the unseen images for the final retrieval. In our approach we accumulate the evidence of the true labels for each image in the database through iterations. This is done by propagating the EEG-based labels of the presented images at each iteration to the rest of images in the database. Our results demonstrate a continuous improvement of the labeling performance across iterations despite the moderate EEG-based labeling (AUC {\textless}75\%). The overall analysis is done in terms of the single-trial EEG decoding performance and the image database reorganization quality. Furthermore, we discuss the EEG-based labeling performance with respect to a search task given the same image database.},

However, algorithms for performing fixation identification are often described informally and rarely compared in a meaningful way. In this paper we propose a taxonomy of fixation identification algorithms that classifies algorithms in terms of how they utilize spatial and temporal information in eye-tracking protocols. Using this taxonomy, we describe five algorithms that are representative of different classes in the taxonomy and are based on commonly employed techniques. We then evaluate and compare these algorithms with respect to a number of qualitative characteristics. The results of these comparisons offer interesting implications for the use of the various algorithms in future work.},

In exp. 1; 2-, 4- and 8-choice RTs were measured in the same Ss under two warning conditions, constant foreperiods of either 0.5 or 5.0 sec. Two groups of Ss had different sub-sets of the 8 signal-response pairs for the 2- and 4-choice tasks. Time-uncertainty was found to interact with number of alternatives in one group not in the other. Closer inspection of the data showed that it was necessary to exert a better control on practice received on different sub-sets of signal-response pairs. This control was achieved in exp. 2 where only 2- and 8-choice tasks were used, and all combinations of two signals were used an equal number of times for the 2-choice task. The effect of time-uncertainty was then found independent of number of choices. It is shown that this result is not necessarily inconsistent with the previous finding that signal relative frequency does interact with time-uncertainty. An important incidental finding is the extent of the differences in RT between signal-response pairs in the multi-choice tasks. These differences are completely context-bound, and vanish when the pairs are considered two by two, as in exp. 2.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

We designed an eye-movement visual search paradigm that allowed us to concurrently record EEG and eye movements while subjects were asked to find a hidden target face in a crowded scene with distractor faces. Fixation event-related potentials (fERPs) to target and distractor stimuli showed the emergence of robust sensory components associated with the perception of stimuli and cognitive components associated with the detection of target faces. We compared those components with the ones obtained in a control task at fixation: qualitative similarities as well as differences in terms of scalp topography and latency emerged between the two. By using single trial analyses, fixations to target and distractors could be decoded from the EEG signals above chance level in 11 out of 12 subjects. Our results show that EEG signatures related to cognitive behavior develop across spatially unconstrained exploration of natural scenes and provide a first step towards understanding the mechanisms of target detection during natural search.},

To deal with this problem, we propose a novel electrode placement on forehead and present an effective method to extract horizon electrooculogram (HEO) and vertical electrooculogram (VEO) from forehead EOG. The correlation coefficients between the extracted HEO and VEO and the corresponding traditional HEO and VEO are 0.86 and 0.78, respectively. To alleviate the inconvenience of manually labelling fatigue states, we use the videos recorded by eye tracking glasses to calculate the percentage of eye closure over time, which is a conventional indicator of driving fatigue. We use support vector machine (SVM) for regression analysis and get a rather high prediction correlation coefficient of 0.88 on average.},

Furthering research into sensemaking for visual analytics may be useful in understanding how user{\textquoteright}s are interacting with visualizations for AI and in developing a naturalistic model of explanation. Conventional approaches consist of human experts applying theoretical sensemaking models to identify changes in information processing or utilizing recorded rationale provided by the users. However, these approaches can be inefficient and inaccurate since they heavily rely on subjective human reports. In this research, we aim to understand how data-driven techniques can automatically identify changes in user behavior (inflection points) based on user interaction logs collected from eye tracking and mouse interactions. We relay the results of a supervised classification system using Hidden Markov Models to predict changes in a visual data analysis of a cyber security scenario. Preliminary results indicate a 70\% accuracy in identifying inflection points. These preliminary results suggest the feasibility of data-driven approaches furthering our understanding of sensemaking processes and interaction provenance.},

Distributions built from classification of random data with cross-validation did not follow the binomial distribution. The binomial test is therefore not adapted. On the contrary, the permutation test was unaffected by the cross-validation scheme. The influence of the cross-validation was further illustrated on real-data from a brain{\textendash}computer interface experiment in patients with disorders of consciousness and from an fMRI study on patients with Parkinson disease. Three out of 16 patients with disorders of consciousness had significant accuracy on binomial testing, but only one showed significant accuracy using permutation testing. In the fMRI experiment, the mental imagery of gait could discriminate significantly between idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients and healthy subjects according to the permutation test but not according to the binomial test. Hence, binomial testing could lead to biased estimation of significance and false positive or negative results. In our view, permutation testing is thus recommended for clinical application of classification with cross-validation.},

The size of the visual span decreased from at least 10 letters in central vision to 1.7 letters at 15{\textdegree} eccentricity, in good agreement with the corresponding reduction of reading speed measured by Chung and coworkers (Chung, S. T. L., Mansfield, J. S., \& Legge, G. E. (1998). Psychophysics of reading. XVIII. The effect of print size on reading speed in normal peripheral vision. Vision Research, 38, 2949{\textendash}2962). In Exp. 2, we measured letter recognition for trigrams (random strings of three letters) as a function of their position on horizontal lines passing through fixation (central vision) or displaced downward into the lower visual field (5, 10 and 20{\textdegree}). We also varied trigram presentation time. We used these data to construct visual-span profiles of letter accuracy versus letter position. These profiles were used as input to a parameter-free model whose output was RSVP reading speed. A version of this model containing a simple lexical-matching rule accounted for RSVP reading speed in central vision. Failure of this version of the model in peripheral vision indicated that people rely more on lexical inference to support peripheral reading. We conclude that spatiotemporal characteristics of the visual span limit RSVP reading speed in central vision, and that shrinkage of the visual span results in slower reading in peripheral vision.},

	abstract = {Target/standard discrimination difficulty and the degree of stimulus "novelty" were manipulated systematically in a three-stimulus oddball task to assess how these variables affect target and non-target P300 scalp distributions for visual stimuli. Wavelet transformation (WT) analyses were performed on the non-target (P3a) and target (P3b) ERPs to assay how the underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was affected by both the difficulty and novelty factors. When target/standard discrimination was easy, P300 amplitude was higher for the target than the non-target across all electrode sites, and both demonstrated parietal maximums. In contrast, when target/standard discrimination was difficult, non-target amplitude (P3a) was higher and earlier over the frontal/central electrode sites for both levels of novelty, whereas target amplitude (P3b) was greater parietally and occurred later than the non-target components and was generally unaffected by non-target novelty level. The WT analyses indicated that appreciable theta activity was related to the more novel non-target stimuli; primarily target component delta coefficients were affected by the discrimination difficulty variable. The findings suggest that target/standard discrimination difficulty, rather than stimulus novelty, determines P3a generation for visual stimuli but that the underlying theta oscillations are differentially affected by stimulus novelty. WT analysis methods are discussed along with the theoretical and neurophysiological implications of the findings.},

	abstract = {Objective. Event Related Potentials (ERPs) reflecting cognitive response to external stimuli, are widely used in brain computer interfaces. ERP waveforms are characterized by a series of components of particular latency and amplitude. The classical ERP decoding methods exploit this waveform characteristic and thus achieve a high performance only if there is sufficient time- and phase-locking across trials. The required condition is not fulfilled if the experimental tasks are challenging or if it is needed to generalize across various experimental conditions. Features based on spatial covariances across channels can potentially overcome the latency jitter and delays since they aggregate the information across time. Approach. We compared the performance stability of waveform and covariance-based features as well as their combination in two simulated scenarios: 1) generalization across experiments on Error-related Potentials and 2) dealing with larger latency jitter across trials. Main results. The features based on spatial covariances provide a stable performance with a minor decline under jitter levels of up to {\textpm} 300 ms, whereas the decoding performance with waveform features quickly drops from 0.85 to 0.55 AUC. The generalization across ErrP experiments also resulted in a significantly more stable performance with covariance-based features. Significance. The results confirmed our hypothesis that covariance-based features can be used to: 1) classify more reliably ERPs with higher intrinsic variability in more challenging real-life applications and 2) generalize across related experimental protocols.},
